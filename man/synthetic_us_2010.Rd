\description{
A dataset containing exposure, confounders, and outcome for causal inference
studies. The dataset is hosted on Harvard dataverse \doi{10.7910/DVN/L7YF2G}.
This dataset was produced from five different resources. Please see
\url{https://github.com/NSAPH/synthetic_data/} for the data processing
pipelines. In the following

\strong{Exposure Data}

The exposure parameter is PM2.5. Di et al. (2019) provided
daily, and annual PM2.5 estimates at 1 km×1 km grid cells in the entire
United States. The data can be downloaded from Di et al. (2021). Features in
this category starts with \emph{qd_} prefix.

\strong{Census Data}

The main reference for getting the census data is the United States Census
Bureau. There are numerous studies and surveys for different geographical
resolutions. We use 2010 county level American County Survey at the county
level (\code{acs5}). Features in this category starts with \emph{cs_} prefix.

\strong{CDC Data}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), provides the Behavioral
Risk Factor Surveillance System (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(2021)), which is the nation’s premier system of health-related telephone
surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their
health-related risk behaviors.

\strong{GridMET Data}

Climatology Lab at the University of California, Merced, provides the GridMET
data (Abatzoglou (2013)). The data set is daily surface meteorological data
covering the contiguous United States.

\strong{CMS Data}

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS) provides synthetic data
at the county level for 2008-2010
(Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (2021)).

The definition of each variables are provided below. All data are collected
for 2010 and aggregated into the county level and in the contiguous United
States.
