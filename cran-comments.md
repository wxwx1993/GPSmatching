Resubmission (August 9, 2021 - current)

Thank you so much for taking the time and reviewing the CausalGPS 0.2.5 package.
The original CausalGPS package was accepted on July 23, 2021. However, later on 
I have received an email regarding some installing problems on macOS and Solaris systems.

I fixed all the raised comments. Here is the summary of changes:

* Added _OPENMP flag to check if omp.h is available or not.
* Tested on most of r-hub configuration successfully. 
* removed redundant package call (glue)
