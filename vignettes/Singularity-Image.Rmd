A Singularity image is an essential part of creating a reproducible container and, eventually, reproducible research. This section explains the steps to create a singularity definition file, build an image, and run a container. The two primary sources for further discussion and details include:

- [Singularity Definition Files](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/definition_files.html)
- [Rocker Project (Singularity)](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/singularity/)


### Setting up the environment

In order to build a singularity image, you need to have singularity installed on your system, and you need to have a root privilege to build an image. There are sufficient instructions to do that (for example, [here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/quick_start.html)). You can also use [Sylab Remote Builder](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder) services.

### Definition File

The Definition File (CausalGPS_rstudio.def) is the recipe for building the image. Please note that we build it upon [rocker/rstudio:4.0.4] image. For more details about generating a Definition File, please refer to [Singularity User Guide](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/definition_files.html).

### Building Singularity Image

To build the image, download the Definition File (CausalGPS_rstudio.def) and run the following:

```r
$ sudo singularity build CausalGPS_rstudio.sif CausalGPS_rstudio.def 
```

Running the command will generate a Singularity image (CausalGPS_rstudio.sif). You can double-check the CausalGPS package version by running the image using the following command:

```r
singularity run CausalGPS_rstudio.sif 
```
This will result in the following format:

```s
Container was created Thu 03 Feb 2022 07:54:45 PM UTC
CausalGPS package installed (ver: [1] ‘0.2.6.9000’)
```

### Run an R Session

If you want to use R in a console, you can follow these steps:

- Run shell command in the image

```r
singularity shell CausalGPS_rstudio.sif
```
and then run R. 

```r
Singularity> R
```
This will provide the following results and will activate R.

```r
R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) -- "Lost Library Book"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)

```

Now, you can run an R command. For example:

```r
> utils::packageVersion("CausalGPS")
# [1] ‘0.2.6.9000’
```

### Run a Rstudio Session

You can also open an RStudio session in your browser by following these steps mentioned in [Rocker Project (Singularity)](https://www.rocker-project.org/use/singularity/).

```r
mkdir -p run var-lib-rstudio-server

printf 'provider=sqlite\ndirectory=/var/lib/rstudio-server\n' > database.conf

singularity exec --bind run:/run,var-lib-rstudio-server:/var/lib/rstudio-server,database.conf:/etc/rstudio/database.conf CausalGPS_rstudio.sif rserver --www-address=127.0.0.1

```

Open your browser and enter this URL: 

```r
127.0.0.1:8787
```
